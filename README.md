PHP l2tp vpn server
=========

This project has been started as my research work about l2tp VPN protocol. I've tried to implement **RFC2661** standart. The code is published under the GPLv3. Feel free to use it.

**current TODO**:

- Implement classes for RFC's defined AVPs
- Implement handling control messages for tunnels
- Implement handling control messages for session
- Implement handling data messages
- Implement PPP-frames transmission/retransmission
